# Face-Detection-System-using-Computer-Vision
The system identifies faces by drawing bounding boxes around them, making it useful for applications like security systems, attendance monitoring, and basic AI-based vision projects.

Project Overview--

This project is a Face Detection System developed using Computer Vision techniques in Python. It detects human faces in real time using a webcam or from images/videos by applying Haar Cascade Classifier provided by OpenCV.

Objectives--

To understand the fundamentals of Computer Vision
To implement real-time face detection
To gain hands-on experience with OpenCV
To detect and highlight faces accurately in images or live video

Technologies Used--

Python
OpenCV (cv2)
Haar Cascade Classifier
NumPy
Webcam / Image Input

Working Principle--

1. The system captures video frames from the webcam.
2. Frames are converted into grayscale images.
3. Haar Cascade Classifier scans the image for facial patterns.
4. Detected faces are marked with rectangular boxes.
5. The processed frame is displayed in real time.

Sample Output--
Real-time video feed
Faces detected and marked with blue rectangles

Applications--

Security & Surveillance
Attendance Systems
Face Recognition Preprocessing
AI & Machine Learning Projects
Smart Cameras

Future Enhancements--

Face recognition using Deep Learning
Emotion detection
Mask detection
Multi-face tracking
Improved accuracy using CNN models
